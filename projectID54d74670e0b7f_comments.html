<HTML><BODY>This little book describes the German attitude towards and involvement in the Armenian genocide, taken from German sources.

<p>Remember that this book was published during WW1, and attitudes towards Germany in England where not positive, to say the least.

<p>A reader has underlined quite a lot of text. This we ignore, but has sometimes confused the OCR, so we have to restore the text.</BODY></HTML>
